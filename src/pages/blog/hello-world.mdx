After years of procrastination, I finally decided to start a blog!

The main reason for starting this blog is to **learn by writing**. Up until now, I've mostly been learning by building/experimenting. However, I've always found that in writing about topics I'm interested in further helps me learn and retain the information better.

I will mostly be writing about topics I come across during my day-to-day work as a software engineer at [Adim](https://adimverse.com). This will mostly cover:

- NextJS & the broader React ecosystem
- AWS Serverless (e.g. DynamoDB, Lambda, S3, etc.)
- TypeScript
- Web3 technologies

Occasionally, I may also write about other topics that interest me, such as:

- Learning new technologies and tools (e.g. Rust, Svelte, etc.)
- Filling gaps in my knowledge (e.g. machine learning)
- Updates on my side projects
- Thoughts on software engineering career paths
- Interesting things I've learned from books, podcasts, and around the web

I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them.
