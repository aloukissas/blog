I'm a software architect, specializing in scalable web and mobile
applications. I have spent the last 10+ years in technology startups,
both as an early engineer and as a technical co-founder.

Currently, I'm a Lead Engineer at [Adim](https://adimverse.com), working on
a web3 platform that enables creators of all kinds to create and own a new
generation of IP.

Previously, I was a Staff Engineer at [Whatnot](https://www.whatnot.com),
where I designed and implemented the infrastructure that supports
[real-time auctions](https://thinkingelixir.com/podcast-episodes/051-live-auctions-with-alex-loukissas/).
I was also the Founding Engineer at [[untitled]](https://untitledinbrackets),
where I designed and built a multi-platform collaboration product for
music creation.

My first foray into startups was joining
[Maginatics](https://web.archive.org/web/20140628160659/https://maginatics.com/)
(acquired by Dell/EMC) as one of the first engineers building an enterprise
cloud file system.

In between, I co-founded a couple fintech startups in [wealth management](https://agentrisk.com/)
and [college savings](http://web.archive.org/web/20180319000951/http://easy529.com/).
I started my career out of grad school at [Cisco Research](https://research.cisco.com/),
working on cloud computing and storage, connected vehicles, software-defined networks,
and smart grid.

I moved to California in 2006 to attend the Master's program in Computer
Science at UC San Diego. During my time there, I co-authored a research
paper on [data center network architectures](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1402967),
which was recognized with the prestigious
[SIGCOMM Test of Time Award](https://www.sigcomm.org/awards/test-of-time-paper-award) in 2018
and also laid the foundation for Google's
[next-generation networking infrastructure](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43837).

In my spare time, I enjoy <s>traveling</s> being a new dad, running, driving
in the Los Angeles canyons, and working on various side projects. I'm also
passionate about Krav Maga, which I've practiced since 2014.
