      <h1>Hi, I'm Alex.</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a software architect, specializing in scalable web and mobile
        applications. I have spent the last 10+ years in technology startups,
        both as an early engineer and as a technical co-founder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm a Lead Engineer at <a
          href="https://adimverse.com"
          target="_blank">Adim</a
        >, working on a web3 platform that enables creators of all kinds to
        create and own a new generation of IP.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I like to build side projects, as a way of scratching
        my curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also <a href="/blog">write</a> about software engineering related topics.
