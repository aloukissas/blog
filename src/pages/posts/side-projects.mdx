As a software engineer, you are constantly creating, building, and maintaining
software systems. But have you ever considered stepping outside of your daily
work and embarking on a side project? In this post, we'll explore the reasons
why side projects are an essential aspect of a software engineer's career.

## What is a side project?

Before we dive into the reasons why you should build a side project, let's
define what a side project is.

A side project is a software project that you build outside of your day job.
Side projects can be anything from a small web app to a full-fledged game. They
can be built for fun, to learn a new technology, or to solve a problem you
encounter in your day-to-day job. Side projects are a great way to explore new
technologies, learn new skills, and build something that you can be proud of.

## Why should you build a side project?

There are many reasons why you should build a side project. Here are some that
I have found to be the most valuable, as a serial side project builder.

### Skill development

Side projects provide an opportunity to expand your skill set. By working on
projects that utilize new technologies, programming languages, and tools, you
can broaden your expertise and become a more versatile software engineer. For
instance, if you primarily work with one programming language, you can start a
side project that uses a different language and learn its unique features. By
exploring new tools, frameworks, and libraries, you can stay current and
relevant in the field.

Just in the last year, I have build side projects that use the following tools:

- [Remix](https://remix.run)
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)
- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
- [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)
- [arweave](https://www.arweave.org)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)

This allowed me to learn about new technologies and frameworks, and potentially
evaluate whether some of these tools could be used in my day job. For instance,
I found Zod to be such an invaluable tool, that we now use it extensively.

Further, it gave me the opportunity to contrast some of these technologies with
the ones I have been using with and evaluate their pros and cons. For instance,
seeing how radically different Svelte's approach for building web apps is from
React's approach was a great learning experience.

### Creativity

Side projects are a great way to flex your creative muscles. By building
something that you are passionate about, you can explore your interests and be
creative in a way that you may not be able to in your day job. Without the
constraints of a work environment, you have the freedom to experiment and try
new things.

For instance, if you are a software engineer who primarily works on backend
systems, you can build a side project that is a frontend-focused web app. Or if
you are a frontend engineer, you can build a backend-focused API. By working on
a project that is outside of your comfort zone, you can explore new areas of
software development and expand your skill set. This environment fosters
creativity and can lead to unique solutions for your main projects.

### Career opportunities

Building a side project demonstrates your passion and dedication to the field,
which can be attractive to future employers. It also gives you the chance to
showcase your skills and portfolio, making you a more attractive candidate.
Employers often look for engineers who have experience in various technologies
and have a passion for the field.

In some cases this could be something you could link to on your resume, ideally
with a link to the source code. In other cases, you may choose to contribute to
an existing open source project. By doing so, you can show your commitment to
the field and make yourself a more attractive candidate to future employers.

### Problem-solving

Side projects are a training ground for problem-solving. They present unique
challenges that require creative solutions, and by tackling these challenges,
you improve your problem-solving skills. These skills are valuable in your
professional life and can be applied to your main projects.

It could be the case that in your day job, you are working on a project that
has had a lot of engineers that have worked on it and certain hard problems
have already been solved. When you're working on a side project, you may need
to solve every problem from scratch. This can be a great opportunity to learn
new skills and improve your problem-solving abilities.

### Networking

Finally, side projects are an opportunity to network with other professionals
in the field. By collaborating with other software engineers, designers, and
stakeholders on a side project, you can expand your network and gain access to
new resources, ideas, and people. Collaborating with others is also a great way
to learn from their experiences and skills.

## How to get started

Now that you know why you should build a side project, let's explore how you
can get started.

### Find a problem to solve

The first step to building a side project is to find a problem to solve. This
can be a problem that you encounter in your day job, or a problem that you
encounter in your personal life. For instance, I started a side project just
for the purpose of evaluating Turborepo, since it seemed like a tool that could
be useful for my day job. I also started a side project to help my wife an I
keep track of our household chores (yes, yet another TODO app ðŸ˜‚).

### Choose a technology

Unless your side project's goal is explicitly about exploring a new technology,
I would caution against experimenting with new technologies when you're
building a side project. The last thing you need is to get bogged down in
learning a new technology and not ship anything. Instead, I recommend using a
technology that you are already familiar with (AKA your Boring Stack). This
will allow you to ship something quickly and iterate on it.

### Build it

Once you have a problem to solve and a technology to use, it's time to build
your side project. I recommend starting with a simple MVP (minimum viable
product) and iterating on it. This will allow you to ship something quickly and
get feedback from users. By iterating on your MVP, you can improve your
product and build something that is useful.

If you're short on time, what I found to be useful is breaking up the project
into micro tasks and working on them in short bursts. This allows me to keep
the momentum and ship something quickly. For instance, if I'm building a web
app, I know I can build a simple login page in under 30 minutes. So I'll start
with that and then move on to the next task. You can use whatever tool you
prefer, but I like to use Github issues for this, since I already use Github as
as repo for my side projects.

### Launch it

Once you have a working MVP, it's time to launch your side project. Again, I
recommend going with tools you already know. For instance, since most of my
side projects are web apps, I use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to host them.

When the project is live, I'll try to share a link to my project (perhaps
paired with a blog post) on a few channels (e.g. Twitter, Hacker News, Reddit,
Indie Hackers etc.) to get some initial feedback. I'll also try to get a few
friends to try it out and provide feedback. This will help me identify any
issues with the product and improve it.

Remember: the initial version of your side project should be something so raw
that you are embarrassed to show it to anyone. But the quicker you launch and
start iterating, the better.

### Iterate on it

Once you have launched your side project, it's time to iterate on it. This
could be adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving the user experience.
The goal is to improve your product and make it more useful for your users.

I recommend using the same process as you did when you were building your MVP.
Break up your project into micro tasks and work on them in short bursts.

## Conclusion

Building side projects as a software engineer is a great way to broaden your
skill set, showcase your work, and improve your problem-solving skills. It's
also a great opportunity to network with other professionals in the field and
contribute to open-source projects.

So, start thinking about your next project today!
